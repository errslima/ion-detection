# Function repository for an Image Charge Detection Simulation

These code samples are a summary of the functions used to generate simulated data for a generalized signal detector.

An overview of some example outputs from the different functions:

### The signal

Generated by signal.py, using an include to functions.py.

The fourier transform of this signal is also calculated.

### Noise

In the simulation we consider white noise and pink noise as artefacts from the detector electronics. The pink noise is known as 1/f noise, which actually includes a beta parameter which is the exponent. In this simulation, beta = 2 so that we have 1/f^2 noise.

Using this data, a cutoff can be made to guarantee a 99% true positive detection rate:
