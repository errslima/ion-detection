# Function repository for an Image Charge Detection Simulation

These code samples are a summary of the functions used to generate simulated data for the image charge detector as described in [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-28167-6) (Paul RÃ¤cke, 2018).

An overview of some example outputs from the different functions:

### The signal

Generated by signal.py, using an include to functions.py.

The fourier transform of this signal is also calculated.

### Two types of noise

In the simulation we consider white noise and pink noise as artefacts from the detector electronics.

Using this data, a cutoff can be made to guarantee a 99% true positive detection rate:
